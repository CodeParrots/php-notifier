#### Documentation

Welcome to the PHP Notifier documentation. Documentation can be found at https://codeparrots.github.io/php-notifier/

To contribute to the documentation you'll want to do the following:

- Clone the `gh-pages` branch
- Edit the file inside of `/pages/` or create a new page in the appropriate section
- Run `$ grunt` to display the menu, and select 'Build Documentation'.
- Create a Pull Request on the `gh-pages` branch with your changes, outlining what has changed and why.

**Notes:**
- If the plugin version changes, you should also bump up the version inside of the documentation. This can be done by running `$ grunt` and selecting the following options:

- 'Update Documentation Version'
- 'Build Documentation'
- 'Deploy Documentation'
